# File-Formats-Finder
# üìÇ Real-Time Folder File Format Validator

This project is a **Python script** that continuously monitors a specified folder and validates the format of newly added files. It checks whether supported files contain **tabular data** (rows and columns) and provides instant feedback in your console.

---

## ‚úÖ **What it does**

- Monitors a target folder **in real-time** for new files.
- Automatically checks the file type and whether it‚Äôs a valid file:
  - **CSV, XLSX, XLS, TXT** ‚Äî checks if they contain rows and columns.
  - **PDF** ‚Äî checks if they contain at least one table.
  - **DOCX** ‚Äî checks if there is at least one table.
- Ignores temporary files (e.g., `~$file.xlsx`).
- Displays clear validation results for each new file.
- Runs continuously until you stop it manually.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **How it works**

1. **Watchdog Library**  
   Uses [`watchdog`](https://pypi.org/project/watchdog/) to detect file creation events instantly.

2. **File Parsers:**
   - [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for reading `csv`, `xlsx`, `xls`, and `txt` files.
   - [`pdfplumber`](https://pypi.org/project/pdfplumber/) for extracting tables from PDF files.
   - [`python-docx`](https://python-docx.readthedocs.io/) for detecting tables in DOCX files.

3. **Validation Logic:**
   - For spreadsheets and text files: checks for at least 1 row and 1 column.
   - For PDFs: searches each page for tables.
   - For DOCX: checks the `tables` property.

4. **Console Output:**
   - ‚úÖ Means the file is valid and contains tabular data.
   - ‚ùå Means the file is invalid or empty.
   - üõë Means a temporary file was ignored.

| `.xls`    | Checks rows and columns using `pandas`    |
| `.txt`    | Assumes tab-separated; checks rows/cols   |
| `.pdf`    | Uses `pdfplumber` to find tables          |
